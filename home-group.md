## Home Groups

Want to try hosting, leading or attending a Home Group? Our Home Group Kickstart is starting soon! This is a 4-week initiative with the option to continue longer term. Study materials will be provided! Home Groups are a life-giving part of community and this is the time to prayerfully consider participating.

If you are interested in being part of a Home Group and/or leading or hosting one please contact us for more information.
