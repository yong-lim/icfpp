## ICF Prayer Page

At ICF, we believe that God's church is called to be a house of prayer for all nations (Isa. 56:7). 

How can we pray for you? (ex., guidance, healing, finances, relationships) 

Confidential (Anonymous) Requests:
If you have a confidential prayer request, please share the details of your need. Our prayer team will intercede on your behalf while maintaining your personal privacy. 

Non-confidential Requests:
For non-confidential prayer requests, a member of our intercessory prayer team will pray publicly for your specific need during the Sunday morning service.

If submitting a request on behalf of another person, please obtain their permission.

We are honored to support you in prayer. The effectual fervent prayer of the righteous accomplishes much (Jam. 5:16).
