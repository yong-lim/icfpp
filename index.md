## Important Announcement - New Location for ICF South

We are excited to announce that **this Sunday, February 2nd, ICF South will hold its first worship service in our new location, the Lim Kim Noy Tower (American Intercon School)**. The start time for services there will be **9:30 a.m.** moving forward. **Concurrently, ICF North services at HOPE School in Sen Sok will begin at 10:30 am.**

This video shares more logistical information about our new location:

For some time, the steady increase in attendance at the South congregation prompted our leadership team to prayerfully consider the prospect of a larger venue. We have been faithful in asking, seeking, and knocking (Lk. 11:9) to find an accessible place with a suitable ambiance and the desired capacity.

The new location is practical for ICF’s vision and values. The change will enhance our fellowship, with more people able to gather in worship and experience God’s presence. Its functionality reflects our commitment to foster spiritual growth and accommodate the needs of parishioners. Also, our prayer ministry, hospitality services, and children’s/youth programs will benefit from the overall flexibility of the site. We trust the relocation will prove favorable over time, helping us better serve the congregations and broader community.

Let us steward the new space with reverence and faith-filled expectation. And may we go out with joy and be led forth in peace (Isa. 55:12).

To Him be the Glory Forever,

Pastor Daniel Newby

## Our Four Core Values:

**Believing** - As a believing community, we seek to prioritize our vertical faith in God (Matt. 6:33).

**Balancing** - An upward faith is balanced with horizontal works and concerns for our faith community and peoples of Cambodia (Matt. 22:37-39).

**Branching** - As a branching community, we intend to extend our reach to bless others.

**Bestowing** - As a bestowing community we give to others what we have received by abiding in the True Vine (John 15:5).
